Data Provided:
You will be given a CSV or Excel file containing records with data such as full name, full address, and other information like SSN, phone number, or date of birth. The data may include:

Duplicate Records
Missing Information
Inconsistencies
Spelling Errors
Example Records:

Tasks:
Task 1: Direct Matching
Objective: Link records that directly match by name.

Instructions:

Identify records where the full names are the same or have minor spelling variations.
Consider abbreviations, nicknames, and common misspellings.
Account for case sensitivity and punctuation differences.
Example:

Records A928147 and A972885 both have the name "FRANCINE J KEGLER" (with minor variations) and are thus a direct match.
Task 2: Indirect Matching
Objective: Perform indirect matching of records connected through an intermediary.

Instructions:

Identify records where one record matches two others via different attributes (e.g., name and address).
Record A matches Record B by name.
Record A matches Record C by address.
Therefore, Records A, B, and C are indirectly linked.
Example:

Record 1: "John Doe, 1701 Westpark Drive Apt 110"
Record 2: "J D, 1701 Westpark Drive Apt 110" (matches Record 1 by address)
Record 3: "John Doe, 1710 Westpark Drive Apt 41" (matches Record 1 by name)
Records 1, 2, and 3 are indirectly matched.
Task 3: Identify Households
Objective: Find records that form a household.

Instructions:

Identify records with different names but the same address.
Account for variations in address formatting (e.g., abbreviations, misspellings).
Example:

"John Doe, 1701 Westpark Drive Apt 23"
"Mary Doe, 1701 Westpark Drive Apt 23"
These records form a household.
Task 4: Identify Household Moves
Objective: Find instances where a household has moved to a new address.

Instructions:

Identify groups of records where the same individuals (by name) are associated with more than one address.
Ensure that the names match despite minor variations.
Account for address changes indicating a move.
Example:

Old Address:
"John Doe, 1701 Westpark Drive Apt 110"
"Mary Doe, 1701 Westpark Drive Apt 110"
New Address:
"John Doe, 1710 Westpark Drive Apt 321"
"Mary Doe, 1710 Westpark Drive Apt 321"
All four records together represent a household move.
Guidelines:
Error Tolerance: Be mindful of spelling errors, abbreviations, missing data, and inconsistencies in the records.
Thoroughness: Be comprehensive in your analysis. Do not overlook potential matches due to minor discrepancies.
Output Format:
Present the results in a clear and organized table format.
Specify Direct Match, Indirect Match etc... seperately
Include all relevant details to make each entity easy to locate and verify.
Explanation:
For each identified link, briefly explain how the entities are connected.
Examples: "Same name with minor spelling differences and identical address," "Different names but identical address indicating a household."
